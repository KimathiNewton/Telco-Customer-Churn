# Predictive Analysis of Customer Churn and Retention Strategies in the Telecommunication Industry: A Case Study of Vodafone telecommunication company

# Aim and Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a customer churn prediction model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churn. By proactively identifying potential churners, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and improve overall customer satisfaction and profitability.
