# Predictive Analysis of Customer Churn and Retention Strategies in the Telecommunication Industry: A Case Study of Vodafone Corporation"

## Introduction
Customer attrition is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. Customer churn otherwise known as customer attrition or customer turnover is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service within a specified timeframe. For instance, if you began the year with 500 customers but later ended with 480 customers, the percentage of customers that left would be 4%. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold.
In this project, we aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.

## Business Understanding
Vodafone is a leadng telecommunication company in EUrope and Africa, led by their mission to connect for a better future.Vodafone Corporation aims to reduce customer churn and improve retention strategies by leveraging machine learning models. The primary objective is to accurately predict the likelihood of customer churn based on historical data and identify the key indicators that drive churn behavior. By understanding the factors influencing churn, Vodafone aims to proactively implement targeted retention strategies to mitigate customer attrition. The marketing and sales teams are eager to receive actionable insights and recommendations that will enable them to develop personalized retention campaigns and enhance customer satisfaction. The project's success will be measured by the reduction in churn rate, improved customer retention, and increased customer loyalty. The available resources include a comprehensive dataset provided by the marketing and sales teams, a designated budget for analysis and model development, and a timeline of three months for the completion of the project. The findings will be presented to the business development unit, marketing, and sales teams, with the expectation that the insights will guide strategic decision-making and contribute to Vodafone's overall growth and profitability.
